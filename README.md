AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


In this challenge we had a task to create a timed quiz using the skills we have learned over the past few weeks. I decided to split the project up by page. I had an html, css, and js file for the Start, Game, Submission and High Scores page. This made it wasy for me to tell where my information was going and how it affected the other. 

First I created my index.html page an style.css. I created my buttons for my page and began to style them. I wanted them to be easily clickable and identifable so I placed a large rem size as well as width and height. 

In my Game html I made containers for each possible question as I wanted to divide out each one for my code. In my Game css file I created large paddings for my choices and created a hover effect for my choices. 

In my Game javascript file I referenced my questions using the new DOM skill we have learned. I defined a variable for accept answers in my line of "let" as well as wrote out all the questions. I created a start game funcction underneath my questions to score and log the questions. I also created a timer that is shown and the bottom left handside of the page. 

In my End files I created a a location to save your intials and your score to the High Scores pages. I used alot of my knowledge of DOM and JSON to get this done. In those pages I had highscores go into a list to be displayed.
